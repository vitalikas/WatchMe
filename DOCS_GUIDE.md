## 💡 Pro Tips

### ✅ Do This
- **Start with app first** - Build and play with it
- **Read in order** - Follow the learning path
- **Focus on essentials** - You don't need everything
- **Practice demo** - More important than reading

### ❌ Don't Do This
- **Read everything at once** - Too overwhelming
- **Skip testing the app** - Demo is most important
- **Memorize everything** - Understanding > memorization
- **Stress about details** - Big picture matters more

---

## 🎬 The 80/20 Rule

**80% of interview success comes from 20% of the content:**

### The Critical 20%
1. ✅ Working demo app
2. ✅ 30-second elevator pitch
3. ✅ Understanding 3 screens
4. ✅ Knowing what DRM, LAR, HLS/DASH mean
5. ✅ Why you built this

**Master these 5 things and you're golden!**

### The Other 80%
- Technical implementation details
- Architecture patterns
- Code organization
- Production considerations
- Edge cases

**Nice to know, but not critical.**
