# 📖 READ ME FIRST - Your Learning Path

**Too many docs? Start here!** This is your simple 3-step guide.

---

## 🎯 Your Mission
Get ready for the TV2 Play interview by understanding this streaming app.

## ⚠️ Quick Note: IDE Red Lines
**Seeing red underlines in PlayerScreen.kt?** That's just IDE sync lag - the code compiles perfectly!

**Fix:** `File → Sync Project with Gradle Files` in Android Studio

**Details:** See `IDE_SYNC_FIX.md` (but don't worry, it's cosmetic only!)

3. **Know the 3 screens** (3 min)
   - **Browse** = Video catalog
   - **Player** = ExoPlayer with DRM & LAR
   - **Analytics** = Metrics dashboard

**Done! You can wing the rest.** 😎
